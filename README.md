# bootstrap-project

This page is a simple HTML/CSS page with Bootstrap integrated in. 

The purpose of this page is to display my knowledge of being able to make pages responsive on different screen sizes and mobile.

The theme is related to my own photography business in giving information about a workshop I might do in the future.
